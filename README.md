# Primer: Your Neural Network Doesn't Know What It Doesn't Know

![gif](https://github.com/continuousml/Awesome-Out-Of-Distribution-Detection/assets/110962703/f462693a-851a-41d6-9301-eba19446fcdc)

OOD Detection represents an emerging trend in deep learning research, focusing on a critical deficiency that often limits the deployment of neural networks in real-world scenarios. Despite the tremendous success, deep learning is usually founded on an important assumption: the data a model encounters during deployment must be 'similar' to what it was trained on, or in other words, in-distribution. Regrettably, our world is not static nor predictable, and neither is the data we feed into our models. A static model that is not adaptive nor robust to changes can quickly become outdated or unreliable.

Equipping a neural network with the ability to say 'no' when faced with unfamiliar input is not merely a convenience; it's an urgent necessity, particularly in safety-critical applications. Understanding and implementing OOD Detection not only strengthens the integrity of a model but also provides a layer of security, ensuring that the vast and unpredictable landscape of real-world data does not become an Achilles' heel for otherwise powerful and sophisticated deep learning systems.

## Datasets

[Photorealistic Unreal Graphics (PUG)](https://pug.metademolab.com/) by Meta AI

> "Abstract: Synthetic image datasets offer unmatched advantages for designing and evaluating deep neural networks: they make it possible to (i) render as many data samples as needed, (ii) precisely control each scene and yield granular ground truth labels (and captions), (iii) precisely control distribution shifts between training and testing to isolate variables of interest for sound experimentation. Despite such promise, the use of synthetic image data is still limited -- and often played down -- mainly due to their lack of realism. Most works therefore rely on datasets of real images, which have often been scraped from public images on the internet, and may have issues with regards to privacy, bias, and copyright, while offering little control over how objects precisely appear. In this work, we present a path to democratize the use of photorealistic synthetic data: we develop a new generation of interactive environments for representation learning research, that offer both controllability and realism. We use the Unreal Engine, a powerful game engine well known in the entertainment industry, to produce PUG (Photorealistic Unreal Graphics) environments and datasets for representation learning. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of PUG to enable more rigorous evaluations of vision models."
